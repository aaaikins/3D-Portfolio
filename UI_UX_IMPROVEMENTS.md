  rightIcon={<SendIcon />}
  loading={isLoading}
>
  Send Message
</Button>
```

### Using the Toast System
```jsx
import { useNotifications } from './components/Toast';

const notifications = useNotifications();

// Success notification
notifications.success("Message sent successfully!");

// Error with action
notifications.error("Failed to send", {
  action: {
    label: "Retry",
    handler: () => retryAction()
  }
});
```

### Using Enhanced Inputs
```jsx
import Input, { EmailIcon } from './components/Input';

<Input
  label="Email Address"

  leftIcon={<EmailIcon />}
  error={formErrors.email}
  value={email}
  onChange={handleChange}
/>
```
